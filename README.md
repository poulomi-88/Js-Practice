# 1st Practice problem
```
1-------2------3------4------5-----6-----7-----8-----9------10
There are 10 points on the x axis and the distance between the points in the given as a Javascript array

distances = [5, 2, 3, 9, 10, 13, 2, 8, 4]
Let us say a user has to go from point A to point B
start = 3(index on the line in the array)
end = 6(index on the line and not in the array)
what is the minimum distance he has to cover if he wants to go directly from start to end
or in the reverse direction
```

# 2nd Practice problem
```
There is a binary string: 
```
**0110001100001**
```
Find out the number of consequetive one's in this string
So in the above case the answer should be 2(as there are two times there are consequetive ones)
```

# 3rd Practice problem
```
Lets say there is line like : 
```
**This line is good and this line is created to find out the number of times the words are used in the line**
```
So when we run the program the output should be an object whose keys are all the words in the line and the value of the keys are how many times that word is used inside the line
For example:
{'his': 1,
         'line': 3,
         'is': 2,
         'good': 1,
         'and': 1,
         'this': 1,
         'created': 1,
         'to': 1,
         'find': 1,
         'out': 1,
         'the': 3,
         'number': 1,
         'of': 1,
         'times': 1,
         'words': 1,
         'are': 1,
         'used': 1,
         'in': 1}
```
