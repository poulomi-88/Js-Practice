1-------2------3------4------5-----6-----7-----8-----9------10
There are 10 points on the x axis and the distance between the points in the given as a Javascript array

distances = [5, 2, 3, 9, 10, 13, 2, 8, 4]
Let us say a user has to go from point A to point B
start = 3(index on the line in the array)
end = 6(index on the line and not in the array)
what is the minimum distance he has to cover if he wants to go directly from start to end
or in the reverse direction
